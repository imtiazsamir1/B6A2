#Features & Technology Stack.
## 1️⃣ Authentication & Authorization

### User Login
- Users can login using **email & password**.
- A **JWT token** is generated upon successful login.

- Two roles: `admin` and `customer`.
- Route access is restricted based on roles.

**Examples:**
- **Admin:** Can view all bookings, manage vehicles.

## 2️⃣ Vehicle Management (Admin)

### Create Vehicle
- Admin can add new vehicles.
- **Required fields:** `vehicle_name`, `type`, `registration_number`, `daily_rent_price`, `availability_status`.
- Duplicate `registration_number` will throw an error.

### Get Vehicles
- Both admin and customers can view the list of vehicles.

### Get Single Vehicle
- Fetch a vehicle using its `id`.

- **Validation:**
  - Vehicle must be available.
  - `end_date` must be after `start_date`.

### Get Bookings (Role-based)
- **Admin:** Retrieves all bookings with nested customer & vehicle info.
- **Customer:** Retrieves only their own bookings with nested vehicle info (customer info excluded).

### Update Booking
